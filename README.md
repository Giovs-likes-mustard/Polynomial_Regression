# Polynomial_Regression
Polynomial regression by using the least squares method

# How to use
Open data.txt, on the first line you need to put the polynomial degree (an int),
on the following lines, place the coordinates of the points in the form x,y
then run the program fit.py.
The program will return the polynomial coefficients in the terminal
and a graphic will be plotted by MatPlotLib.

data.txt already comes with several data.
It was the data used to generate the graphic above,
you can use this as an example of how to put your data in data.txt.
