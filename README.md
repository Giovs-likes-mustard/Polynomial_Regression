# Polynomial_Regression
Polynomial regression by using the least squares method
![Figure_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68389235/87842681-a3f1ea00-c884-11ea-9517-7f10a0e976f1.jpeg)

# How to use
open data.txt, on the first line you need to put the polynomial degree (a int),
on the following lines, place the coordinates of the points in the form x,y
then run the program fit.py.
The program will return the polynomial coefficients in the terminal
and a graphic will be plotted by MatPlotLib.

if you want an example, open example.txt, copy the numbers and paste them
into data.txt, you will generate the graphic in the image above.
